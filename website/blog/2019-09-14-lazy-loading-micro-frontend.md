Demo code [here](https://github.com/marconi1992/ara-spa-demo).

Micro-frontends solve some organizational and technical problems, nevertheless, they could cause other ones. As software architects we need to take decisions to solve the most critical problems and figure out how to mitigate the new ones caused by the chosen solution.

> True success requires sacrifice â€” Rick Riordan

In this article, we'll learn how to mitigate some of them.

<!--truncate-->

## Network Overload (Performance issues)

Micro-frontends can deliver its JavaScript bundle independently. However, the host application needs to download a file for each Micro-Frontend it consumes. In the worst scenario, it could need to download a bunch of files affecting the performance for its initial load.

## Refresh Host Page (Developer experience issues)

Another issue comes during the development cycle. For a Monolith Frontend application is easy to refresh the page any time the code changes using a live reload tool. However, for Micro-frontends this task becomes more difficult because the host application only consume the JavaScript bundle for each Micro-Frontend and their underlying code is outside its boundaries.

## Webpack Nova Consumer

We created [webpack-nova-consumer](https://github.com/ara-framework/webpack-nova-consumer) to tackle the problems mentioned above. This plugin supports live reloading across Micro-Frontends(Novas) and lazy loading for the JavaScript bundles in production mode. 

We'll see it in action later through this article.

## Set Up Host Application (Nuxt SPA)

First, create a Nuxt application in `spa` mode:

Note: Choose `Single Page App` for the `Choose rendering mode` option.

```shell
create-nuxt-app nuxt-spa
```

Inside the folder `nuxt-spa`, run the nuxt application in http://localhost:3000:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Browser:

![nuxt-spa](/website/img/blog/nuxt-spa.png)

After running the application we'll see a page rendering the example page for nuxt.

## Set Up Micro-frontend (Foo Nova)

Create a new Nova using the [CLI](https://github.com/ara-framework/ara-cli):

Note: Type `n` when the `Do you want to include Server-Side Rendering (SSR)` option appears to include only the client-side entry point.

```shell
ara new:nova -t vue foo-nova
```

For production, we need to build the client-side entry point and deploy it in a storage service such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and distribute it through a CDN. However, for development, we'll serve it using [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).

Serve the JavaScript bundle in http://localhost:8080/client.js

```shell
yarn dev
```

Notice, the `foo-nova/src/components` folder contains a component named `Example` that is used in the entry point `foo-nova/src/index.js` file. We'll render it in the nuxt application next.

## Implement Micro-frontend (Foo Nova) in Nuxt

First, we need to install the [Nova Bridge](/website/docs/nova-bridge) for Vue.js. This package provides a component to include Nova views inside Vue.js based applications.

```shell
yarn add nova-vue-bridge
```

Update the file `pages/index.vue` with the following code:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <logo />
    <nova name="Example" :data="{ title: 'Ara Framework' }"/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Nova from 'nova-vue-bridge'
import Logo from '~/components/Logo.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    Logo,
    Nova
  }
}
</script>

<style>
.container {
  margin: 0 auto;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
```

Run the nuxt application again:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Browser:
![nuxt-logo-only](/website/img/blog/nuxt-logo-only.png)

After running the application the page shows only the Nuxt logo because we're not loading the JavaScript bundle for the `Foo Nova` yet. However, if we inspect the HTML elements in the browser we can notice the Nova Bridge renderers the placeholder where the Micro-frontend (Nova) view will be mounted.

```html
<div data-hypernova-key="Example" data-hypernova-id="8f07d513-0c84-4b16-8058-08cf2a014d0d"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-hypernova-key="Example" data-hypernova-id="8f07d513-0c84-4b16-8058-08cf2a014d0d"><!--{"title":"Ara Framework"}--></script>
```

## Load JavaScript bundle using Webpack Nova Consumer

Install [webpack-nova-consumer](https://github.com/ara-framework/webpack-nova-consumer) in nuxt application.

```shell
yarn add --dev @ara/webpack-nova-consumer
```

After installing the package, import the NovaConsumer plugin and add it inside the `extend` section in the `nuxt.config.js` file.

`nuxt.config.js`

```js
import NovaConsumerPlugin from '@ara/webpack-nova-consumer'

export default {
  ...
  build: {
    /*
    ** You can extend webpack config here
    */
    extend (config, ctx) {
      config.plugins.push(new NovaConsumerPlugin({
        novas: [
          {
            entry: 'http://localhost:8080/client.js',
            views: [
              'Example'
            ]
          }
        ]
      }))
    }
  }
}
```

The `NovaConsumerPlugin` receives an object with the information of the Micro-frontends (Novas) it's consuming:

- `entry`: JavaScript bundle that contains the entry point for the Micro-frontend.
- `views`: List of view names that the Micro-frontend supports.

Browser:

![foo-nova](/website/img/blog/foo-nova.png)

After running the nuxt application again we'll see the Micro-Frontend rendered.

## Live Reloading

Now, we can update the `Example.vue` component in the `foo-bar/components` folder and the host application (nuxt) will reaload the page showing the latest changes.

Update `Example.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <input type="text" v-model="title">
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['title']
}
</script>
```

Live Reloading in action:

## Set Up Micro-frontend (Bar Nova)

In order to test our nuxt application using more than one Micro-frontend we'll create a new one named `bar-nova`.

Create a new nova following the same steps mentioned before.

```shell
ara new:nova -t vue bar-nova
```

Change the view name from `Example` to `Bar` in `src/index.js`:

```js
import { load, Vue, mountComponent, loadById } from 'hypernova-vue'
import Example from './components/Example.vue'

const render = (name, { node, data }) => {
  if (name === 'Bar') {
    return mountComponent(Vue.extend(Example), node, data)
  }
}

document.addEventListener('NovaMount', ({ detail }) => {
  const { name, id } = detail

  const payload = loadById(name, id)

  if (payload) {
    render(name, payload)
  }
})

load('Bar').forEach(render.bind(null, 'Bar'))
```

Serve the JavaScript bundle in http://localhost:8081/client.js

```shell
yarn dev
```

## Implement Micro-frontend (Bar Nova) in Nuxt

We need to create a new page named `bar` where we'll implement the `Bar` view. we'll also add a link in the main page to navigate to the `bar` page.

Create a new page `pages/bar.vue`:

`bar.vue`

```vue
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <div>
      <logo />
      <nova name="Bar" :data="{ title: 'Bar Page' }"/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <nuxt-link  to="/">Main Page</nuxt-link>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Nova from 'nova-vue-bridge'
import Logo from '~/components/Logo.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    Logo,
    Nova
  }
}
</script>

<style>
.container {
  margin: 0 auto;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
```

Add a link to the `bar` page in the `pages/index.vue` file:

`index.vue`

```vue
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <div>
      <logo />
      <nova name="Example" :data="{ title: 'Ara Framework' }"/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <nuxt-link  to="/bar">Bar Page</nuxt-link>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

Add new entry point in the `nuxt.config.js` file:

```js
import NovaConsumerPlugin from '@ara/webpack-nova-consumer'

export default {
  ...
  build: {
    /*
    ** You can extend webpack config here
    */
    extend (config, ctx) {
      config.plugins.push(new NovaConsumerPlugin({
        novas: [
          {
            entry: 'http://localhost:8080/client.js',
            views: [
              'Example'
            ]
          },
          {
            entry: 'http://localhost:8081/client.js',
            views: [
              'Bar'
            ]
          }
        ]
      }))
    }
  }
}
```

Browser:

![bar-nova](/website/img/blog/bar-nova.gif)

After running the nuxt application again we'll see the views are rendered navigating from one page to other. We'll test the lazy loading feature next.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is enabled automatically using webpack in production mode. The plugin adds a `nova-lazy-load` script in the built app. Behind scenes, this script listens to the `NovaMount` event emitted by Nova Bridge in order to load the JavaScript bundle that mounts the requested view.

Build nuxt application:

```shell
yarn build
```

Install `http-server` to serve the static files:

```shell
npm i -g http-server
```

Go to the `dist` folder and serve the static files in http://127.0.0.1:3000:

```
http-server . -p 3000
```

Browser:

![lazy-loading](/website/img/blog/lazy-loading.gif)

Notice, the JavaScript bundle for the Bar Micro-frontend is loaded only when the user navigates to the `bar` page. In general, the Nova bundles are only loaded when one of their views is placed on the page.
